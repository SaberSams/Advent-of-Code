    "The night before Christmas, one of Santa's Elves calls you in a panic. \"The printer's broken! We can't print the *Naughty or Nice List*!\" By the time you make it to sub-basement 17, there are only a few minutes until midnight. \"We have a big problem,\" she says; \"there must be almost *fifty* bugs in this system, but nothing else can print The List. Stand in this square, quick! There's no time to explain; if you can convince them to pay you in *stars*, you'll be able to--\" She pulls a lever and the world goes blurry.\n",
    "\n",

    "When your eyes can focus again, everything seems a lot more pixelated than before. She must have sent you inside the computer! You check the system clock: *25 milliseconds* until midnight. With that much time, you should be able to collect all *fifty stars* by December 25th.\n",
